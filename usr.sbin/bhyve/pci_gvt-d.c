 * Note that the graphics stolen memory is somehow confusing. On the one hand
 * the Intel Open Source HD Graphics Programmers' Reference Manual states that
 * it's only GPU accessible. As the CPU can't access the area, the guest
 * shouldn't need it. On the other hand, the Intel GOP driver refuses to work
 * properly, if it's not set to a proper address.
 *
 * Intel itself maps it into the guest by EPT [1]. At the moment, we're not
 * aware of any situation where this EPT mapping is required, so we don't do it
 * yet.
 *
 * Intel also states that the Windows driver for Tiger Lake reads the address of
 * the graphics stolen memory [2]. As the GVT-d code doesn't support Tiger Lake
 * in its first implementation, we can't check how it behaves. We should keep an
 * eye on it.
